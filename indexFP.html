            <br>
            <span class="bold">Niki de Saint Phalle (French pronunciation: [niki d(ə)
              sɛ̃ fal]) born Catherine Marie-Agnès Fal de Saint Phalle;</span> was a French-Americansculptor, painter,
            filmmaker, and author of colorfulhand-illustrated books. She was born on October 29, 1930, in
            Neuilly-sur-Seine,
            Hauts-de-Seine, near Paris - one year after Black Tuesday;
            the French economy was also suffering in the aftermath of the infamous stock
            market crash that initiated the Great Depression. Her father was Count André-Marie de Saint Phalle
            (1906–1967),
            a
            French banker, and her mother was an American, named Jeanne Jacqueline Harper (1908–1980).Marie-Agnès was
            the
            second
            of five children. Within months of her birth, her father's finance company closed, and her parents moved
            with
            her oldest brother to
            the suburbs of New York City; she was left with her maternal grandparents in Nièvre, near the geographical
            center
            of
            France. Around 1933, she rejoined her parents in Greenwich, Connecticut; In 1937, the family moved to East
            88th
            Street and Park Avenue in the affluent Upper East Side neighborhood of New York City.
            By this time, Marie-Agnès was known as "Niki", the name she would use from then
            on. <br>
            Niki grew up in a strict Catholic environment, against which she repeatedly rebelled. Her mother was
            temperamental
            and violent, beating the younger children, and forcing them to eat even if they were not hungry. Both of her
            younger
            siblings, Elizabeth and Richard de Saint Phalle, would later commit suicide as adults. The atmosphere at
            home
            was tense; the only place where Niki felt comfortable and warm was in the kitchen, overseen by a black cook.
            Decades later, Niki would reveal that she had suffered years of sexual abuse from her father, starting at
            the
            age
            of
            11. She would later refer to the environment where she grew up as enfer ("hell").

          <span class="bold"> FIRST PERSIOD: MARRIAGE, CHILDREN AND ART | 50s:</span>
          <br>
          At the age of 18, Nicki married Harry Mathews. Although her parents accepted the union, her husband's
          family objected to her Catholic background and cut them off financially, causing them to resort to
          occasional
          shoplifting. Their first child, Laura, was born in April 1951.
          In 1952, the small family moved to Paris. The new parents were casual, even negligent in their care.
          Saint Phalle rejected the staid, conservative values of her family, which dictated domestic
          positions for wives and
          particular strict rules of conduct. However, after marrying young and becoming a mother, she found herself
          living
          the same bourgeois lifestyle that she had attempted to escape.
          <br>
          In Nice, Saint Phalle and Mathews would have separate affairs in 1953; after she attacked her husband's
          mistress,
          she took an overdose
          of sleeping pills. When Harry discovered a stash of knives, razors, and scissors under a mattress,took
          his wife to a mental clinic in Nice, where she was treated
          with electroshock therapy and insulin shock therapy. In September 1954, the small family moved to
          Deià, Majorca, Spain,
          her son Philip was born in May 1955.
          In 1956, she met the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely and his wife, artist Eva Aeppli.
          Saint
          Phalle attempted her first
          large-scale sculpture, enlisting Tinguely to make an iron armature, which she covered with plaster
          and
          paint.
          In 1959, Saint Phalle first encountered multiple artworks by Yves Klein, Marcel Duchamp, Daniel Spoerri,
          Willem
          de
          Kooning, Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, and Jasper Johns. Seeing these avant-garde
          works
          triggered
          her
          first great artistic crisis.She switched from oil painting to gouaches and gloss paint, and began to
          produce
          assemblages from household objects and castoffs.By this time, she had decided to dedicate
          herself fully
          to creating art, free from the obligations of everyday family life.
          <br>
          In 1960, she and Harry separated by mutual agreement, and her husband moved to another apartment with their
          two
          children. Mathews would occasionally buy artworks from his wife as a way of providing her modest support,
          and
          she
          would
          visit him and the children periodically.She soon moved in with Jean Tinguely.He was
          becoming well known for his kinetic sculptures made from cast-off mechanisms and junk.In many ways,
          the pair were
          opposites, and sometimes had violent disagreements, and frequent affairs with others.They would
          live together intermittently and collaborate closely on artistic projects for over a decade before marrying
          in
          1971.Two years later they separated, but remained on good terms and continued to collaborate on
          various
          projects up through Tinguely's death in 1991.

            Ihren Lebensweg als Künstlerin beginnt Niki de Saint Phalle 1953 nach der Behandlung eines
            Nervenzusammenbruchs.
            Sie
            fasst den Entschluss, die im Jahr zuvor begonnene Schauspielausbildung nicht weiterzuverfolgen, sondern
            sich
            als
            bildende Künstlerin zu etablieren. Bald wendet sie sich von der klassischen Malerei ab und gestaltet
            zunächst
            farbige
            Assemblagen – Kunstwerke, auf deren Bildträgern plastische Objekte nach dem Collageprinzip montiert sind.

          <span class="bold">Shooting Paintings| 60s</span> <br>
          Niki de Saint Phalle began her journey through life as an artist in 1953 after being treated for a nervous
          breakdown.
          She decided against continuing to pursue the training as an actor that she had begun the previous year, and
          instead
          chose to establish herself as a visual artist. She soon turned away from classical painting and initially
          designed
          colorful assemblages – artworks on whose picture carriers plastic objects are mounted in a collage. <br>
          Saint Phalle’s Shooting sessions belong to the artistic form of expression of Happenings,
          events
          improvised directly
          with their spectators. In the 1950s, for instance Allan Kaprow in New York or the Japanese avant-garde group
          Gutai
          Art
          Association (Jap. Gutai Bijutsu Kyōkai) interacted with their audience for the first time. The aim was to
          expand
          the
          traditional concept of art and to break open the strict division between art genres. In France, the call for
          a
          new
          kind
          of art was represented by the Nouveaux Réaliste artistic movement around the art critic Pierre Restany. Niki
          de
          Saint
          Phalle joined the group in 1961 as its sole female member. <br>
          Niki de Saint Phalle developed the idea of destroying her own works in radical Shooting sessions while
          participating
          in
          “Comparaisons, Peinture – Sculpture” (Engl. Comparisons, Painting – Sculpture), a group exhibition in Paris
          in
          February
          1961. There, the artist allowed visitors to throw darts at a picture of her husband, whose head she had
          replaced
          with a
          target. Next to her work, the Belgian artist Bram Bogart presented a pure white relief, which gave rise in
          Saint
          Phalle
          to a vision of a bloody picture overflowing with color. <br>
          For the so-called “Shooting Paintings”, the artist attached bags of paint, food cans, rope or
          plastic objects, and
          containers filled with spaghetti or eggs to a wooden panel and covered them with white plaster. Shots were
          then
          fired at
          the relief. In her “Shooting Painting” from 1961, the arrangement of the objects did not follow any specific
          narrative.
          It was first in later works that Saint Phalle designed interconnected scenarios, which then characterized
          her
          spectacular Shooting sessions even more clearly as a protest against social constraints and politically
          motivated
          violence. Each action not only aimed to destroy the original picture, but also resulted at the same time in
          the
          chance
          creation of a new work.

          <p class="woman-identity" style="height: 245px;">
            <strong>WOMAN IDENTITY</strong> <br>
            The artist confronted viewers with the role of women that prevailed in Western societies at the time and
            reflected
            their
            depiction in the mass media. At the same time, she celebrated the female body, its fertility and power, as
            well
            as
            the
            social achievements that women were realizing in the twentieth century in Europe and the United States. <br>
            Niki de Saint Phalle addressed the figures of bride, mother, and child-bearer again and again.
            As a result of their size and mass, these objects function as large figures of women with voluptuous forms
            on
            the
            one
            hand. On the other, their bodies, whose surfaces are covered with plastic toys and found objects become a
            macabre
            spectacle. These figures are frequently interpreted as an experiment with the “possibilities of being a
            woman.”
            They
            can, however, also be seen as a socio-critical examination of female identity that call into question the
            traditional
            picture of women.

            more than one ton of an older work by the artist. The original version of the sculpture, which was created
            with

            The

            sculptures.

          <p> <strong>NANAS</strong><br>
            A new series of works to which Niki de Saint Phalle gave the title “Nanas” was created in 1965. In these
            female
            figures
            with extremely voluptuous forms, trust in the future of a different existence for women in society becomes
            palpable. The
            colorfully painted sculptures no longer show the ambiguity of Saint Phalle’s earlier assemblages. They are
            voluptuous
            women with full breasts, rounded bellies, large buttocks, and small heads that express vitality and
            strength.
            <br>
            The term “Nana” calls to mind the English word “nanny” and transcribes the notion of roundness and abundance
            with
            its
            onomatopoeic sound. At the same time, it also makes one think of the French author Émile Zola’s novel of the
            same
            name
            about a prostitute in Paris. Saint Phalle’s first “Nanas” were made of wire, papier-mâché, fabric, and wool.
            A
            short time later, Saint Phalle worked
            on more stable constructions made from strong solvent-based polyester, a material used in the boat building
            industry.
            This new material made the figures weather-resistant and robust. Inhaling the poisonous material while
            producing
            them,
            however, gave Saint Phalle a lung abscess that led to several stays in the hospital starting in 1974.
            Sensual and brimming with strength, the <strong> "Black Mosaic Nana"</strong> extends her powerful arms and
            gracefully lifts one leg
            to
            dance. From the small head with no face to the spherical breasts and from the broad hips to the feet,
            everything
            about
            this voluminous figure is curvy. The larger-than-life polyester sculpture adorned with mosaic stones of
            glass
            and
            ceramic radiates cheerfulness. With her lively body posture, the "Nana" announces her joy in being a woman
            and
            being
            able to bring something into being. <br>
            When referring to her "Nanas", the artist spoke of a “celebration of women,” of figures that are oppressed
            by
            neither by
            men nor by their life. The female figures became Saint Phalle’s new weapon in her mission against men’s
            wishful
            thinking
            about a female body reduced to a sexual object.
